## 🎨 Design Details from Figma

- **Fonts**
  - `Source Sans Pro`
  - `Spin Cycle OT`
  - If these fonts are not installed locally, you can download `Source Sans Pro` from font providers (e.g., Google Fonts) and obtain `Spin Cycle OT` from the Figma assets or the provided font source.
- **Measurements**
  - Some measurements in the design use floating-point values.
  - You may round them to the nearest whole number for simplicity, as long as the overall visual fidelity remains intact.

- **Colors**
  - **Links hover/active:** `#FF6565`
  - **Buttons hover/active:** `opacity: 0.9`
  - Ensure color contrast is accessible and matches the Figma file.
